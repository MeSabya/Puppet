### Puppet Master
Puppet Master is the key mechanism which handles all the configuration related stuff. It applies the configuration to nodes using the Puppet agent.

### Puppet Agent
Puppet Agents are the actual working machines which are managed by the Puppet master. They have the Puppet agent daemon service running inside them.

### Config Repository
This is the repo where all nodes and server-related configurations are saved and pulled when required.

### Facts
Facts are the details related to the node or the master machine, which are basically used for analyzing the current status of any node. On the basis of facts, changes are done on any target machine. There are pre-defined and custom facts in Puppet.

### Catalog
All the manifest files or configuration which are written in Puppet are first converted to a compiled format called catalog and later those catalogs are applied on the target machine.

## Puppet − Workflow

- In Puppet, the first thing what the Puppet master does is to collect the details of the target machine. Using the factor which is present on all Puppet nodes (similar to Ohai in Chef) it gets all the machine level configuration details. These details are collected and sent back to the Puppet master.

- Then the puppet master compares the retrieved configuration with defined configuration details, and with the defined configuration it creates a catalog and sends it to the targeted Puppet agents.

- The Puppet agent then applies those configurations to get the system into a desired state.

- Finally, once one has the target node in a desired state, it sends a report back to the Puppet master, which helps the Puppet master in understanding where the current state of the system is, as defined in the catalog.

## Puppet − Key Components
Following are the key components of Puppet.

### Providers
Providers are basically fulfillers of any particular resource used in Puppet. For example, the package type ‘apt-get’ and ‘yum’ both are valid for package management. Sometimes, more than one provider would be available on a particular platform. Though each platform always have a default provider.

### Manifest
Manifest is a collection of resources which are coupled inside the function or classes to configure any target system. They contain a set of Ruby code in order to configure a system.

### Modules
Module is the key building block of Puppet, which can be defined as a collection of resources, files, templates, etc. They can be easily distributed among different kinds of OS being defined that they are of the same flavor. As they can be easily distributed, one module can be used multiple times with the same configuration.

### Templates
Templates use Ruby expressions to define the customized content and variable input. They are used to develop custom content.
