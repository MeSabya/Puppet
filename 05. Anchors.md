## What Anchors Actually Do
- Anchors are dummy resources that exist purely to enforce ordering across loosely coupled classes.
- They don’t do anything on the system — they just exist in the catalog to create a dependency chain.

### What happens if I don’t use anchors in a base class that includes many modules?
Puppet won’t guarantee the order. Modules may be applied in non-deterministic order, leading to bugs that only happen sometimes.
Puppet applies resources in any order by default, unless you explicitly tell it to do otherwise.
Sometimes, we want to coordinate multiple, loosely-coupled classes to apply in a specific order — but we don’t want them to know about each other directly (for modularity, reuse, etc).

### How does an anchor affect the catalog?
Anchors add extra resources and edges that enforce ordering. You can see these in the catalog when inspecting it.
