## How puppet works on a standalone system and on a multinode system.

Please note that these diagrams are conceptual and don't include all possible components or details.

### Standalone System:

```
+--------------------------+
|                          |
|  +---------------------+ |
|  | Puppet Manifest     | |
|  | (e.g., webserver.pp)| |
|  +---------------------+ |
|             |            |
|  +---------------------+ |
|  | Puppet Apply        | |
|  | (puppet apply)      | |
|  +---------------------+ |
|             |            |
|  +---------------------+ |
|  | System Configurations| |
|  | (e.g., ssh, users)   | |
|  +---------------------+ |
|                          |
+--------------------------+
```

#### Puppet Manifest:
Contains configurations (e.g., webserver.pp) that describe the desired state of the system.

#### Puppet Apply:
Applies the configurations in the manifest to the local system.

#### System Configurations:
Puppet applies configurations to the standalone system, managing packages, services, and files.


### Multi-Node System:

```
+--------------------------+
|                          |
|  +---------------------+ |    +---------------------+
|  | Puppet Master       | |    | Puppet Manifests    |
|  |                     | |    | (e.g., webserver.pp)|
|  +---------------------+ |    +---------------------+
|             |            |             |
|  +---------------------+ |    +---------------------+
|  | PuppetDB            | |    | Puppet Apply        |
|  | (Optional)          | |    | (puppet agent)      |
|  +---------------------+ |    +---------------------+
|             |            |             |
|  +---------------------+ |    +---------------------+
|  | Puppet Agents       | |    | System Configurations|
|  | (Nodes)             | |    | (e.g., ssh, users)   |
|  +---------------------+ |    +---------------------+
|                          |
+--------------------------+
```

#### Puppet Master:
Central server that stores Puppet manifests and serves configurations to nodes.

#### PuppetDB (Optional):
Optional component that stores data generated by Puppet, such as facts and reports. It allows for better scalability and reporting.

#### Puppet Agents (Nodes):
Each node runs a Puppet agent, which communicates with the Puppet master to retrieve and apply configurations.

#### Puppet Manifests:
Manifests (e.g., webserver.pp) are stored on the Puppet master and describe the desired state of the system.

#### Puppet Apply (Agent):
Puppet agents run periodically or on demand to retrieve configurations from the Puppet master and apply them locally.

#### System Configurations:
Puppet manages configurations on individual nodes based on the manifests stored on the Puppet master.
